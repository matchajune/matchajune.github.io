## The project idea

The original idea was to create a rendition of **Tetris**. However, we decided that Tetris would be too mainstream and not fun to implement. Then, it was decided to implement Bubble Breaker with the hopes of possibily deploying it to iOS. Then, the group decided that Bubble Breaker would be too easy to implement and too hard to implement new features. And finally, after much discussion, **Haunted** was born: a multiplayer Pac-man.

## Calling it early

Every person was assigned a topic to go over for the night in order to see what our options would be for the front end and back end:

  * Julius: Angular.js
  * Cassie: Game engines
  * Rootul: Backbone.js
  * Sid: JavaScript
  * David: Firebase

And with that, the group called it an early night. Although we were all enthusiastic about the project and ready to dive straight in, it was agreed that slow and steady wins the race. The last thing that we wanted was to burn out early. Therefore, everyone agreed to set fair, clear goals of what needed to be done by the end of the day.

Cheers to the next week! We all hope to create an awesome project to share with everyone!
