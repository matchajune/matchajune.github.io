There was a lot of tension in our cohort today. I feel like it was because of the students' superego talking, as well as the material being covered in the challenges got 100x harder suddenly today. There was optional yoga for phase_2 students this morning, but only 10 students participated out of 30.

Like all Wednesdays, I decided to go solo today and go over some advanced ActiveRecord. The challenge was to create associations between the tables user, hotel, room, and booking.

I definitely need to go over ORM and how Ruby and SQL communicate with each other. Unfortunately, I spent all of today studying this one challenge so I couldn't do the other challenges that went over Sinatra. In addition, I have my presentation tomorrow so I want to practice hard so I can amaze my cohort!

Today is the first day where I feel like I don't deserve to sleep. I will study throughout the night and hopefully catch up on my work. As a lot of students said, "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity." I can sleep when DBC is over, but for now I will do my best to push myself!
