This past weekend, I finally checked ayahuasca off my bucket list. Going into it, I only knew what I’d read online, and in hindsight, I see how much misinformation is out there. Most of the accounts I found were from people seeking the experience itself, so I had no idea there was an entire religious dimension involved. Now, to honor what I went through, I feel I should do my due diligence and learn more about the traditions and beliefs the shamans described before the ceremony.

## Top 3 Ayahuasca-Based Religions

### Santo Daime

*Raimundo Irineu Serra*

Santo Daime emerged in the early 20th century under the guidance of Raimundo Irineu Serra (Mestre Irineu) in the Brazilian Amazon. Central to its practice is the sacramental use of ayahuasca, called “Daime”, prepared from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the Psychotria viridis leaf. This tradition blends Catholic devotion, indigenous Amazonian elements, and African spiritual influences, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of Brazil.

Ceremonies typically include prayer, singing of hymns (hinos), and sometimes dancing, all taking place in a setting where participants wear white or light-colored attire. The core beliefs emphasize universal love, moral conduct, and a deep respect for nature as a manifestation of the divine. Legally recognized in Brazil, Santo Daime has also gained a following internationally, though regulations on ayahuasca use differ from country to country. Individual churches honor the lineage of Mestre Irineu, often led by “padrinhos” or “madrinhas” who maintain the doctrines and spiritual framework.

### União do Vegetal (UDV)

*José Gabriel da Costa*

União do Vegetal, founded by José Gabriel da Costa (Mestre Gabriel) in 1961, also hails from the Brazilian Amazon and shares many parallels with other ayahuasca, based movements. Its central sacrament is “Hoasca,” the same brew of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, though UDV refers to it under its own terminology. The name “União do Vegetal” signifies a union of plant spirits and underscores the importance of communion and harmony in spiritual practice.

UDV ceremonies are relatively formal, involving prayer, reflection, and teachings led by a mestre within an organized structure. Members strive for moral and ethical development, mutual respect, and a collective sense of unity. Like Santo Daime, UDV is legally recognized in Brazil and has made headway abroad, notably securing the right to use ayahuasca in the United States under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Its communities emphasize sobriety, personal responsibility, and spiritual study, creating a dedicated environment for introspection and interpersonal support.

### Barquinha

*Daniel Pereira de Mattos*

Barquinha arose around 1945, founded by Daniel Pereira de Mattos (Daniel da Barquinha) in Acre, Brazil. As with the other ayahuasca traditions, Barquinha centers on a brew of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, similar to Santo Daime and UDV. Its name, meaning “little boat,” symbolizes a spiritual voyage or safe passage, reflecting the community’s focus on charity, healing, and moral uplift.

Rituals often incorporate Catholic prayers, spiritist practices, and reverence for the Amazon, showcasing a unique blend of syncretism. Barquinha places particular emphasis on spiritual healing, mediumship, and service to others, considering these acts fundamental to an individual’s inner transformation. Although it is smaller in global presence than Santo Daime or UDV, Barquinha maintains legal standing in Brazil and continues to uphold Daniel Pereira’s teachings through close-knit congregations that prize cooperation, communal support, and a devotion to the sacred Amazonian tradition.

## My Personal Journey

### Pre-Ceremony Preparation

The ceremony I attended was under the Santo Daime tradition. The shamans strongly advised following a special diet beforehand: foods low in salt, sugar, spicy ingredients, and alcohol, along with sexual abstinence, to purify both body and mind. They believe this helps the ayahuasca’s effects unfold more smoothly. They also mentioned that if we cannot sacrifice something from our daily lives leading up to the ceremony, why should the gods sacrifice time to see us? Additionally, they encouraged me to reflect on what I hoped to learn or heal.

### Purging

The shamans emphasized that vomiting (or other forms of purge) is a natural part of the experience. They described it as the body expelling not only physical toxins but also emotional or spiritual burdens. By framing purging as part of the healing, I was encouraged to surrender to it rather than resist. This approach hopefully would reduce my anxiety when the purge happens. However, I was surprised that I did not purge at all during my journey.

### Gathering Mental and Emotional Strength

The shamans explained that they create a safe environment using protective rituals, such as blowing smoke (mapacho), offering prayers, and singing “icaros” (healing songs). These elements are meant to help participants feel supported and protected during challenging moments. Although I didn’t feel I specifically needed those rituals, I still appreciated them throughout the ceremony.

### The Journey Itself

During the ceremony, the shamans sang icaros and played instruments to guide the energy of the session. I was impressed that they spent the entire time singing and playing, and I admired their stamina. The music is supposed to anchor participants, helping them navigate visions and providing a comforting reference point. No matter how deeply I ventured into my thoughts, listening to the icaros quickly brought me back to reality.

Shamans explained that ayahuasca can bring up deep memories, suppressed emotions, or spiritual visions. Typically, participants are instructed to remain open, observe without judgment, and trust the process—even if it becomes intense. I personally did not experience vivid visions, nor did I encounter deep emotional releases. However, the Daime allowed me to think more clearly about what I need to do in my life to reach greater happiness, along with the flaws in my thinking process that I should address going forward.

### After-thoughts

The shamans stressed respecting the brew and the sacred nature of the ritual; I quickly changed my mindset about wanting the largest dosage possible, realizing that would be disrespectful to the process.

During the ceremony, my friend’s brother received a silver star, which everyone celebrated. In Santo Daime, getting a silver star signifies a deeper commitment to the tradition and marks a more official role within the community. It’s often worn over the heart and indicates that the recipient has met certain requirements—such as consistent ceremony attendance and adherence to guidelines—and is ready to assume further responsibilities in that spiritual path.

I’m definitely curious about exploring UDV in the future to see how it differs from Santo Daime. Each branch seems to have its own unique approach to ayahuasca, and I want to understand those distinctions firsthand.
