It’s 8 a.m. and we’re still coding. WHAT?! This project has been both fun and challenging, but most of all it has kept us up for long periods of time. Despite the difficulty and strain, we have stuck together and not lost our minds...yet. 

I worked with Julius all night on refactoring our code base from the mess it was (functions everywhere?? and no file structure) to a more object oriented version. We put everything into object literals to make our code more readable. Furthermore, we worked on several different functionalities for our game. I am proud to say that pacman is animated and our ghosts don’t just sit in one place all the time.

Everyone else has been working very hard as well. David spent all night trying to learn tile mapping and create an awesome board for our game. Cassie is a front-end champ! She organized everything into modals (she learned vex modals overnight and implemented it) and did more front-end design. Rootal has been hard at work at updating player positions using firebase so that we can create a great multi-player experience. 

There’s a lot of work to be done. But we’ve made our MVP, if not a little more. It’s important to respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy. I’m happy to say that none of us are walking away from this project anytime soon.
