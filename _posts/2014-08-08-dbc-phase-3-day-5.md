I knew I would be unable to wake up. I woke up at 8:45AM today because of the lack of sleep I've been getting this week. I stumbled onto my feet and quickly ran out the door. I had to decide whether or not I should drive into the city and be a few minutes late, or take the subway and be an hour late; I decided to drive in and thus ran to the car.

## Integrity

I was a little disappointed with myself for letting myself be late for the first time at Dev Bootcamp. On the first day of Dev Bootcamp, I had to choose between three options: integrity, kindness, and effort. The reason why I chose integrity was because I thought that devoting myself to Dev Bootcamp was already putting in a lot of effort and commitment and I already try to work hard to be kind to everyone everyday. I think that integrity is slowly dwindling away this generation. For example, students don't have the integrity to clean up after themselves, leaving used cups all over the space and not washing the dishes they used for lunch. Therefore, I want to challenge myself to raise the bar for integrity and make sure that I am honest to myself and to Dev Bootcamp for the 9 weeks that I am here. And to break that promise for the first time really made my heart sink, **especially** since I only had 2 more weeks to go.

I will get a lot of rest this weekend so I push myself to never feel that disappointment again with myself.

## Projects

Today was consisted of working on group projects all day. I had to create everything about the user experience. For example, I had to make sure a user would be able to login, logout, edit their profile, create comments and queries if logged in, and unable to do so if logged out. I volunteered to be merge master so I could get a better understanding of how to work with a team, and how git worked in order to make sure all teammates were on the same page, despite working on separate features. One unfortunate thing that happened was while I was merging and updating the master, I lost some of my work. I tried to ```git checkout``` to the most recent commit that I have made. Unfortunately, that did not work.

One thing that I feel bad about working as a group is that I seem to be working a lot slower than the rest of my group. I was hoping that I wouldn't feel like I would be slowing down the group dynamic, but I guess that was inevitable because I am learning so many things every day. I will have to dedicate more hours to this project so I am a valuable asset to my group!

## Confusion

This first week flew by way faster than expected. I am in the same state as all my first weeks during a new phase: sink vs swim. Dev Bootcamp was definitely correct when stating that I would have to start getting comfortable feeling uncomfortable.

Well, time to get started with the projects! I'll try to write updates during the weekend to track my progress!
