...I didn't sleep because I wanted to code all right. Now, here's the crazy thing. My friends are wondering how I have so much energy. And the weird things is, I don't know! I love these all nighters, coding through the night. I think I found my zen here at Dev Bootcamp!

## The fight for knowledge

An awesome friend and I decided to work through the night and study rails, rspec, and practice [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) by creating a web app from the ground up. It was a little difficult to get into the habit of writing the rspec test first, and then writing working code to make the test pass. Either I wanted to write lines and lines of code without testing, or write lines and lines of testing without actual code. And I think to get into the habit of continuously committing each change my partner and me made to the code was good! The instructors here at Dev Bootcamp kept telling us how in the real world, it is very good practice to commit each change with a descriptive message so other people may know the goal of the commit is.

My partner and I had many discussions over the course of the night, arguing different ways to implement code, which methods were being deprecated as supposed to methods that were new, how to time-box our limited time throughout the night, and organizing which topics were most important to fully understand. Of course all the topics are important, but my partner and I knew that there was just not enough hours in the night in order to cover them all.

I absolutely loved how the night went. In my opinion, the best type of knowledge is the knowledge I struggle and fight for: not the knowledge that is fed to me. This is because if knowledge is easily spoon-fed to me, I know that I would forget it within the next couple of days. However, if I fight to learn a specific topic because I don't understand it, I will at least remember the knowledge for longer periods of time than having the knowledge given to me. This is because there is an emotion tied to the knowledge that I learned now; I think that humans are driven with emotion more than logic. I am happy my partner was willing to 'fight' with me for knowledge. When I asked him on how he felt about the session last night, he was very happy to confidently tell me that he has no regrets doing it, and he knew the material much better than two nights ago. I am happy to say the same!

## Projects

This weekend is one of the last projects that I will be doing at Dev Bootcamp. I volunteered to be project manager and tried my best to get my group pumped up to work on this project with me!!

> Good evening all,
> 
> I think that the areas of discussion for today’s project went well. Fortunately, the flow of the conversation wasn’t interrupted and we were all able to contribute enough to get the ball rolling.
> 
> Like **** stated, we have all day to code tomorrow for this week’s project. I will do my best to get a nice, clean, working Rails skeleton pushed to master this evening. This will allow a base for all of us to start branching off and coding magical features to the project in the morning.
> 
> Please make sure to always create a pull request when your task/feature is complete. Upon agreement and discussion if need be, I will go ahead and communicate with you all to pull the latest version of master.
> 
> I would like to call for a quick check-up at 9:15AM sharp in the morning at our phase_3 corner to make sure we are all on the same page before moving forward with the implementations.
> 
> I am a concoction of emotions right now; I am very happy to be working on an awesome idea with you all, but bittersweet as well because this will be one of the last group projects I will have at Dev Bootcamp. And with that said, let’s go about with a bang and give it our all, leaving no regrets at Dev Bootcamp!!
> 
> TEAM AWESOME.....ARE YOU READY!??!?!??!?!?!?!?

The goal of the e-mail was to pump them up for the projects, but I'm not sure if I succeeded. I'm proud to say that all the members of my group are highly motivated to create an awesome application and very mature to not ignore responsibility. Before we all meet up tomorrow, I'm going to try to complete the models, migrations, and a working, base, rails skeleton for the group to work with tomorrow. One of the reasons why I studied hard throughout last night was to make sure that I am a strong member of the final group projects. And this weekend is to prove to myself that the sacrifice paid off.

## No regrets

I am working hard to make sure that I have no regrets when I graduate from Dev Bootcamp. This means giving lightning talks to phase_1 and phase_2 students about blogging, things I personally learned during my time here at Dev Bootcamp, topics that the students want to go over, or even open discussions. Not only do I think makes the Dev Bootcamp community stronger, I am humbled to meet such great people at the space. And not only that, I get to practice public speaking and get a stronger firm on the material I have learned over the weeks here at Dev Bootcamp by teaching it to the other cohorts.

But for now...the sleep god Hypnos calls for me. Have a great night all!!!
