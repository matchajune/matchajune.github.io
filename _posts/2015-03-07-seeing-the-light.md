I made one of my 2015 resolutions to be that I open up an Instagram account and attempt to take pictures of my life; I was never a person to take pictures and put it [on the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CewJ-ihIqaM). What blew my mind apart was the fact that Instagram can be used for many other things other than pictures; users use Instagram to setup their stores, or users use Instagram as a [marketing platform](http://austenallred.com/user-acquisition/book/chapter/instagram/).

## The problem

Today, I went to South Pattaya to walk around the night market that was setup there.

It was amazing how many stores were setup with each their own Instagram account, Facebook account, and Line account for online presence. Some stores went full out with their own boards with all their pertinent information,

while other stores just had a screenshot of the articles of clothing they were trying to sell on Instagram:

No matter how a store attempted to display their online presence to their customers, there were a couple of questions that immediately came to mind:

	1) How are foreigners supposed to shop at their 
	favorite stores when they go back to their country?
	2) How can these local stores expand their business
	and reach international buyers if they wanted to?
	3) How can buyers know what types of stores are setup
	that particular day without having to walk through the
	entire campus setup?
	4) How can buyers view the stores' items without going
	to the local nightmarkets and writing down their
	Instagram account?

Although there were many other questions I had, these questions sticked out most for me at that time.

## A solution

Hopefully within the next couple of months, I will be able to come up with a solution to these questions I had and present the solution in a swift manner. I think that this problem is an amazing challenge to tackle, and hopefully I will have something to present within the next couple of months!!

Cheers to my next project venture!

PS. Here are some cute puppies I saw while at the night market:
