The whole day was spent anxiously waiting until 2:00PM; today was pitch day. My cohort set the record for the amount of ideas pitched which was awesome. That meant that everyone had more ideas to choose from, and filter the ideas from there.

When the group was assembled and the instructor was writing the groups on the board, I saw that I was in the group that was going to do the Tetris idea. So the group and I got together and discussed what we were going to do. For one thing, the group immediately changed the idea of Tetris, since it was too mainstream. I will write a blog post based solely on my experiences and adventures with my final project group.

## Goodnight!

Unfortunately, I had a **massive** migrane later during the day, so I went home early to try to sleep it off. It got so bad that I wanted to just pass out during the subway ride home. I called it a day at 9:30PM.
