A lot has happened since the last time I've updated my website. A quick summary of what has happened since Wednesday:

	* I did yoga again on Thursday. I love how straight my spine feels and how my stretched muscles feel.
	* I had to review [linked lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) because it is very confusing to me with a partner most of Thursday.
	* I was very happy when I found out that there was a dance class during lunch; I missed dancing!
	* I spent all of Friday's time solving the sudoku challenge with my partner.

During one of DBC's group meetings after the check-in, a lot of students shared how they thought there aren't enough teachers, there is no indicator to distinguish whether or not they are sinking vs swimming with the material, and they don't know if the curriculum will be of any use after graduation. During the meeting, I was thinking how they were all valid points to bring up. However, most of the students that were sharing their dissatisfaction were mostly all phase_1 students. 

In the morning, my group and I spent the morning discussing how we should solve the sudoku challenge. Basically, we needed to solve how to make Ruby solve any given sudoku board. Some of the pseudocode was written on the whiteboard. To be honest, although people stated how difficult the sudoku challenge was going to be, it was much easier than the boggle board challenge.

In my opinion, I think that the students are feeling this way because they don't trust DBC. This would be a perfect example of a catch-22. Almost all of the phase_1 students stated how they dropped everything that they were doing previously in order to pursue DBC, whether it be a job, or hanging out with a particular group of friends everyday for the summertime, or attending a college/university in order to obtain a degree. Some students even stated that although their parents advised against attending DBC, they did it anyway. Others even moved from California to be here in New York DBC. They all trusted that DBC would be able to advance their journey to becoming a developer; they all definitely must have trusted DBC enough if they are all willing to drop $12,200 for their service. However, once they got here, they all immediately start to distrust DBC and shared their dissatisfactions on Friday. Maybe it's because the students' expectations didn't live up to what they expected from DBC. Maybe it's because of DBC's system of holacracy, which is fairly new if compared with sociocracy. I don't know. However, I think the students should keep trusting DBC and try to maintain a strong will.

I've realized that phase_1 is different from phase_0 because in phase_0, you had a certain number of challenges that were to be completed by Sunday each week; this is the mindset I had when I entered phase_1. However, I learned on Friday that DBC gives you more work than you can finish every day. This is because DBC didn't want students to complete some challenges and then just call it a day. This makes sense because a developer's journey is a road of never ending learning.

I am usually very reserved with my thoughts and I like to keep them to myself most of the time. However at DBC, I have this urge to find ways to give back to DBC's community. One idea is to create something that is a hub for all personal DBC blogs. Therefore, potential students can reference these blogs as supposed to DBC website's FAQ. In addition, one of the challenges during phase_0 was to revamp our github.io website using HTML/CSS or Jekyll. I chose to use Jekyll, and was quickly swamped with the amount of new information I had to learn. Unfortunately, the tutorials online did not help me enough as well. Therefore, I want to build the courage to hold a class to teach what I've learned reading about Jekyll thus far. At DBC, when a student or teacher wants to have quick, separate sessions about anything, these are called 'lightning talks'.

Overall, I'm very happy with the material I am learning at DBC. In addition, I am very happy with the cohort group I am with; they are all so nice, eager to learn, and come from wonderful, colorful backgrounds. And most importantly for me, I am very confused how for the first time in my life, I am so happy to wake up every morning to learn coding. After all this time in my life, did I finally find something I have a true, burning passion for?
