Despite sleeping a little bit late yesterday, I woke up ready to take on the day today! In addition, the morning was really awesome because of the fall breeze that blew through the town. I really love the crisp, cold, air filling my lungs as I walk towards the bus. Yes, I knew that today was going to be a good day!

## Plan of action

I love mingling with students and teachers at the Dev Bootcamp space a little bit more than I should. I love hearing stories of the students' own adventures of Dev Bootcamp, and how awesome it is to hear the experience be very different than mine. There are days where I don't get to code as much as I want to because of this reason, as well as the lectures and other things going on. Therefore, I started to feel like I was falling behind. Fortunately for me, I want to remedy this problem as soon as possible. Therefore, I packed my toiletries in my backpack before I left for Dev Bootcamp today, ready to pull one of my infamous all-nighters.

Fellow peers were surprised and impressed the last time I was able to pull it off. I felt like it was an awesome session to learn all the material I was confused about and catch up. "Julius, you'll burn out." "Julius, you'll be tired." I don't argue with those comments because they are all true. However, this is my chance to prove to myself how strong I really am. And I'll be able to catch up on my sleep after I graduate from Dev Bootcamp in a couple of weeks, so why spoil myself with the pleasantries right now?

## The day

I spent all day struggling with Rails. Rspec was actually okay for me. I was practicing TDD, or test driven development by writing the rspec while implementing my Rails skeleton: models, controllers, views, and migrations. However, I came to a complete stop when I was unable to write the Rails syntax for some of the controller methods. Therefore, I decided to do the [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) on Rails and follow along the instructions. I was so happy that I did them because it really helped solidify my knowledge on Rails. Sadly, Code School's [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) tutorials weren't as good as I hoped it would be; they were a little cheesy as well. My plan of action for tonight is to finish the challenges for today, and make a basic Rails app with rspec TDD in order to solidify my knowledge. In addition, with final projects in the next coming weeks, I want to be a very strong candidate for people to work with; I don't want to be 'extra baggage' for my teammates.

## See you tomorrow

I will write an update on how my night goes. But besides that, I will quickly go back to coding. Wish me well!
