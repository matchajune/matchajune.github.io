A rocket-ship is shaky when it first launches from Earth. However, when the rocket-ship successfully goes into orbit in space, everything is smooth sail from then on. Analogously, I feel like phase_1 was the launch phase for the rocket-ship and phase_2 is the rocket-ship orbiting in space.

There isn't much to write about these days because I feel like it's just smooth sailing from now on until the end of phase_2. I am currently working hard to understand ActiveRecord and Sinatra. One of the challenges to do today was to replicate the website [craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites#US). I feel like this challenge is awesome to do on my own over the weekend and create a public repository in my GitHub account; I also want to do this with the Sudoku challenge.

I signed up for a lightning talk on different ways to map many-to-many relationships in ActiveRecord. I am excited for this lightning talk because I want to improve my public speaking! In addition, I mentioned in my blog post yesterday how I miserably solved the factorial recursion problem incorrectly in front of phase_1 and phase_2 students. I also want to practice my public speaking skills so I never have to feel so embarrassed again. My plan is to write a technical blog on my topic and to rehearse my presentation!

I plan on resting up a lot this week, but also working hard when I can.
