It took a while for us to start diving into the project this morning. Everyone was settling in and just having a typical morning filled with coffee, Dev Bootcamp check-in groups, and recapping on what was done yesterday.

## Yesterday recap

A stand-up was called as soon as we all settled in, and discussed on what was accomplished yesterday:

  * Facebook / Twitter / Regular Login
  * Constantly deploy working project to Heroku
  * Firebase chat
  * Load assets
  * Toggle between ghosts
  * Move each character

## Today's goals

We were all happy with what was accomplished yesterday, and then discussed on what needed to be accomplished before lunchtime today:

  * Julius - Create tests for the code, and work on the character eating the candies
  * Cassie - Obtain coordinates as a JSON object in order to send to Firebase
  * Rootul - Modularize Firebase chat
  * Sid - Work on disabling diagonal movement, work on random movements for ghost characters, and work on character eating the candies
  * David - Obtain coordinates as a JSON object in order to send to Firebase

The group still plans to have a working MVP by Saturday morning. Cheers to working hard and more importantly, having fun today!
