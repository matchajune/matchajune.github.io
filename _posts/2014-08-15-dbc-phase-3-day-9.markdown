Today was spent all day on projects. We quickly dove into the tasks needed to be done. One of the group members suggested that we keep a blog on our project's [readme](https://github.com/red-spotted-newts-2014/haunted) with the hopes that potential employees would see what everyone did for the projects: the work that was done, the group dynamic, and how we approached problems we faced.

Unfortunately, I won't be updating as much as I normally do with these DBC daily blogs because a lot of what I feel and do will be done on the group blogs I update.

If there's anything to take from today's reading, it is that I am surprised that I am more happy and having fun with the final projects than stressed and tired. Everyone in the group is having so much fun that it's definitely rubbing off on me as well.

Cheers to the next couple of days!!!!
