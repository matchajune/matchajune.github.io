For the past two days, everything is now routine: yoga, lectures, coding, 'EE', coding. I can sense the material is getting tougher. This last week of phase_1 is focusing a lot on database schemas and ActiveRecord. I am always in a confused state, but slowly trying to work through it.

'EE' this week was talking about topics that are hard to talk about, such as religion and politics. I could easily tell that the exercise was difficult because people decided to talk about other peoples' problems, people refused to talk, or people talked about topics that are a part of everyday conversation. I talked about my role as a first-born son in a Korean American family.

I sometimes get the feeling that time is starting to exponentially speed up. I would be able to elaborately talk about all the things I would think and do during my time at DBC, but now, when I try to think back to what I have accomplished for the day, I cannot think of anything. Maybe it might even just be that I am burned out. However, I am doing my best to make sure I am enjoying my time here at DBC more than anything. How can I not when I'm surrounded by amazing people, attending 'EE' with all of them each week?

Tomorrow is assessment day. Assessment day is a day when you take a test to determine whether or not you are allowed to proceed to the next phase. I was originally very nervous at first, but as I was helping other people understand topics, I was surprised how I knew such information. For example, I didn't think I knew about class inheritance, but when a fellow cohort member asked me about it, I was able to articulate the topic well enough for him to understand.

I am scared that once phase_2 starts, I will start falling behind and start burning out. I hope that I am strong enough to keep up the pace, and have the discipline to prevent burning out.
