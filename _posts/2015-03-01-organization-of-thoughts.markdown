I have been drowning with questions for the past couple of weeks. I have been researching for answers online, but never thought to organize my thoughts into a blog post...until now!

## Opportunities everywhere

There are opportunities everywhere after graduating DBC. My parents want to replace a 10+ year old software they are using for inventory and purchase orders. My cousin needs to have a web application built to organize team registration for a dance competition he runs. A friend wants to build a lending startup in Thailand. 

While I was learning and practicing writing code in the US for these projects, it was hard to sustain such a living without some income. This made me wonder how people building startups in New York sustain a living without any investments nor salaries ([question](https://www.quora.com/How-can-people-building-a-tech-startup-sustain-living-in-New-York-without-any-investments-or-salary-for-their-startup)). This led me to choose the opportunity in Thailand that I had in order to minimize living costs and concentrate on just code.

## The beginnings of a startup

I had an obscure vision when leaving for Thailand on the startup I wanted to create with my partner. I knew I had a lot of research to do in order to know how to proceed with creating a startup:

	* How do I even start a startup?
	* How do I calculate equity splits?
	* How do I proceed with the hiring process?
	* Do I build a desktop or web application?
	* What do I do with my other projects?
	* Do I have the strength to build a startup?

My super-ego is telling me that I am too lazy to successfully complete such a task and I should have just worked a normal job back in the US. Although there are a lot of good resources online, it's hard to find a resource that exactly describes the situation I am in.

## How to keep track of progression

I need to find the best way to track progression. I am thinking about maybe writing a weekly blog post every Monday as one way to keep track of my thoughts and progression.

## Resources

Here is a list of resources that helped clarify some of the questions I had:

## Last thoughts

I'm scared out of my mind, but I hope that I am able to have something to show for after a set amount of time. I hope to be able to organize my life, my thoughts, and my journey well enough for others to enjoy reading and also possibly learning from.
