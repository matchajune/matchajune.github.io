Phase_2 has started! I had to come in a little bit earlier today to welcome the new, incoming cohort: the woolly-bear caterpillars. And just like how I was warmly welcomed on my first day of DBC, it was time to give back to the DBC community and happily welcome the wooly-bear caterpillars. We all circled around and introduced ourselves, and had a catered breakfast.

The senior cohorts, woodchucks, gave us all lightning talks on ActiveRecord, Sinatra, AngularJS, and JQuery. I was embarrassed because I had to ask what each one was at the beginning of each talk. However, I learned during phase_1 that I need to take hold of my own learning, so I asked all the questions I wanted answered.

It was then time for lunch, and DBC got catered tacos. It wasn't until 3:00PM that my cohort members and me started coding. This was because my cohort gave lightning talks to the new phase_1 students. I volunteered immediately because I thought it would be good practice for public speaking and solidify my learning. The topic I had to discuss was recursion. It was very embarrassing because the base case I stated for the factorial recursion was ```return 1 if fact(0)```. This is wrong because the base case needs to end the recursion, and should not have any recursion in it; it should have been ```return 1 if n == 0```. I guess this embarrassment is good for me because I will never make this mistake ever again!

So at 3:00PM, I paired up with a fellow cohort student and quickly dove into Sinatra and ActiveRecord. I learned a lot about Sinatra, and my partner suggested to do the [Sinatra tutorials](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/singing-with-sinatra--net-18965). So I will go and do the tutorials now! I am more excited about phase_2 than overwhelmed and scared. Cheers to the next, three weeks!!!
