The air was a little tense at Dev Bootcamp today. I think a lot has to do with how tomorrow is pitch day: a day where all students and instructors pitch their ideas to phase_3 students on final project ideas they can work on. There was some discussion last Monday on what ideas the students were thinking about, but that was last Monday. I definitely thought that the cohort could have benefited more from discussing ideas today, rather than last Monday.

## My idea

The idea that I have been pondering for weeks now is to make a game. The game would include a lot of original logic, math, and algorithms: my favorite! However, another thing I wanted was to make sure that the game wasn't an exact copy of what is out right now; the game would have to be innovative. However, I am having such a hard time coming up with a good idea that I almost wanted to call it quits on the game idea and just turn it into a solo project after graduation. A good friend urged me on and give me the confidence I needed in the idea. Either my friend or I will pitch the idea tomorrow, but I made it clear to my friend that I wanted to view other ideas as well. I'm nervous...and excited...but nervous.

## The sprint begins

And tomorrow shall begin the first day of the sprint I have been preparing for: the sprint for final projects. I left Dev Bootcamp early in order to rest up and study up on my gem talk tomorrow on [d3js](http://d3js.org/). I am ready to pull all nighters constantly in order to get the project completed and presentable. As I have been preparing, I also want my team members to be proud of the work I contribute, as well as being happy around my presence. I will survive!!!!
