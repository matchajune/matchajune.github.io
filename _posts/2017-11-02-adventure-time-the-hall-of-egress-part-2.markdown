### Finn’s Present

Finn is known for being very logical when it comes to problem solving and is no stranger to completing perplexing dungeons. “The Hall of Egress should be no different,” Finn thought…

*Headspinning snowman!*

As Finn explores the dungeon hall, he starts understanding the rules to this dungeon:

  * There is no way to open the Hall of Egress door.
  * Closing the eyes allows one to walk through the door.
  * At any point the eyes are opened, one must return to the hall.
  * When one returns to the hall, the time is reset to when one first entered the hall.
  * The memories of what happened up to the point when one opens his/her eyes are kept when the time is reset.
  * While the eyes are closed, the dungeon will cease to exist.

Finn learns these rules as conclusions from interacting with the dungeon, **even after he exits!** This means at **ANY** point Finn opens his eyes, he returns to the dungeon hall! Therefore, he chooses to live back home with his friends Jake and BMO, with his eyes closed.

The circumstances in which Finn is living his life are totally different now because of the fact that he is literally trapped in an *infinite loop.* However, the environment has not changed at all. He lives back at home. He is surrounded by close friends. Unfortunately, the close friends continuously play a prank on Finn and force open his eyes.

BMO convinces Finn to be a *Nike* commercial and **JUST DO IT.**

Jake, the dog, does not know the meaning of *personal space* because he is…a dog.

Once Finn’s patience is at its limits, he has a heart to heart talk with his best friend, Jake.

> Finn: Yeah, you’ve done it, like, 30 times now. It’s like programmed into your DNA or something.

> Jake: Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right? Look at it from where I’m sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see…that’s like the literal definition of a hallucination. Either all that stuff is a dream, or like, I’m a dream…and I ain’t no dream, ya heard?

Finn has no language framework to communicate the situation that he is currently in, to Jake. Jake will never see what Finn is going through. If Finn is the *only* person that sees what he sees, then Occam’s razor tells Jake that he is is not wrong to conclude that Finn is hallucinating.

##### Makes me wonder if every person in this world suffers minor forms of hallucinations within his/her own objective reality…

### Current status update

Every time Finn tries to *see* things differently from another perspective before he actually acquires it, nothing will change; Finn’s timeline was reset 30+ times as a result of Finn’s static state of mind. The dungeon symbolically represents Finn’s original perspective on life, the checkpoint in a save file Finn always returns to upon failure. Therefore, Finn needs to acquire a different perspective, a different view on life, before trying to open his eyes once more.

##### Thesis Part1: Present self-image cannot exist without the past.
##### Thesis Part2: The autobiographical rulebook of the past is always referenced when writing the present.
