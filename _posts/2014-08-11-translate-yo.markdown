> One of the most fundamental characteristics of human nature is a soul’s desire to explore reality and search for meaning in the universe – the mind longs to understand. Language is the medium by which we can think about and describe our understandings of reality.

Unfortunately, there are so many languages that are spoken in this world today. There are many online resources that may facilitate the communication, but a lot of the meaning can be lost in translation. We attempted to tackle this problem by creating a user-friendly space in our application for users to ask other, real users around the world for a close to perfect, if not perfect, translation. And if you are pressed for time, don't worry; using BingAPI, you will be able to receive a quick automated translation for your to-go needs!

Good morning everyone! My name is Julius, (and my name is Farheen, and my name is Stella, and my name is Adam, and my name is Hilary) and we all warmly introduce to you...*[Translate Yo](http://translate-yo.herokuapp.com/)*!

## Part 1: CSS / Language on Home Page / Globe

Aesthetics play a huge role in developing a trust with the users. We needed a way to convert this Frankenstein of a website into a Frankenfine!

## Part 2: Queried Translations / Post query / Search Query

The user would now want to post a query to receive a translation. He/she can either post a new query, or search for queries that have been already posted by other users.

## Part 3: Comments / Comments of Comments / UpDown Votes

Unfortunately there are people that might mis-translate phrases incorrectly on purpose. That's why each query has a comments section with up/down votes in order to prevent such disaster.

## Part 4: Bing Translation / Testing

None of this would have been possible, yet even functioning as well as it is now without the rigid TDD our group enforced. We wanted at least 80% test coverage, and the question is if we were able to reach it!

## Part 5: Team Practices Used

On Thursday afternoon, we were all out of ideas until Stella proposed the idea of *Translate Yo*! Farheen was amazing with making sure our group followed protocol with Trello and asking all of us for a 5 minute stand-up every couple of hours. Adam stated that he was going to be at the DBC space on Sunday, and encouraged all of us to come as well! Hilary helped me out when I was digging myself a deep hole. And although we all helped create an application to connect people together with language, at least the group and I didn't need an application to help us connect with group dynamic.
