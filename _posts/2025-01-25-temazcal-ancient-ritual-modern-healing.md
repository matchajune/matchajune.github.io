I am celebrating my birthday a week late with some early morning canoeing. It was part of a birthday present that included a temazcal experience. I was never much of a morning person, but I did enjoy the peace and tranquility the quiet waters brought.

The crisp air was just what I needed to prepare for what I thought would be a relaxing temazcal: a spa day, nothing spiritual, just a good detox. I was completely wrong.

### Temazcal?

Temazcal is an ancient Mesoamerican sweat lodge used for purification, healing, and spiritual renewal, historically aiding warriors, the sick, and women in childbirth. Unlike portable sweat lodges, it is typically a permanent structure made from materials like volcanic rock, adobe, or wood, with steam generated by pouring water over heated volcanic stones. It remains an important tradition in Indigenous cultures of Mexico and Central America for health and spiritual practices.

### Initial Thoughts

I expected it to be similar to a Korean spa, where I would stay inside for some time, sweating out impurities from my body. Little did I know it was a 3 hour commitment. The energies between men and women are considered different, so the group I was with took turns entering the temazcal. Before stepping inside, we performed a purification ritual and expressed gratitude to Mother Earth for the opportunity.

The experience felt very similar to the [ayahuasca trip](https://matchajune.io/2024/12/17/from-matcha-to-ayahuasca/) where the temazcalero alternated between singing, chanting, and speaking about how we confront life's challenges. He spoke of 4 "doors" we were to open during the experience, each symbolizing a different phase of purification and transformation. With every door, the heat would rise, and we were to respect the process.

### The 4 Doors

#### First Door – Physical Cleansing
- Focuses on purifying the body by sweating out toxins.
- Often includes prayers or chants for gratitude and connection to the Earth.

#### Second Door – Emotional Release
- Encourages participants to release emotional burdens and traumas.
- Guided chants or reflections may focus on healing the heart and emotions.

#### Third Door – Mental Clarity
- Represents cleansing of the mind, letting go of limiting beliefs or negative thoughts.
- Encourages focus, intention-setting, and mental renewal.

#### Fourth Door – Spiritual Rebirth
- Symbolizes rebirth and connection to the divine.
- Participants emerge from the temazcal renewed, as if being born again from the womb of Mother Earth.

Each door is opened when the temazcalero pours water over the hot stones, intensifying the steam and heat, marking a deeper phase of the journey. The four doors are linked to the four cardinal directions, four elements, and stages of life, making the ceremony a profound holistic transformation.

### My Journey

At first, I still felt cold after the first two doors. Some people were even chanting "HOTTER!", which I found disrespectful, especially after the temazcalero emphasized respecting the process. But by the third door, they fell silent. The heat started taking over my thoughts. The air became dense, humid, thick, and hot. It was difficult to breathe. The steam hissed as water hit the volcanic stones, while chants echoed through the darkness, keeping us conscious, keeping us from passing out. Instruments that people volunteered to play stopped; there was no energy for distractions.

All I could think about was leaving. I wanted to tap out. But I forced myself to stay.

Then the fourth door opened. People began lying down, surrendering to the heat. I wasn’t sure if I was transcending or just barely surviving. My heart pounded, and I had to remind myself with every breath: stay, just breathe.

I was wrong. This was not a relaxing sauna. It was raw. It was natural. A completely organic, mind-altering experience with no drugs involved.

### The Aftermath

Stepping outside, I felt light. Refreshed, renewed, reborn. The stress I carried from work, from life all disappeared. It was strange because I wasn’t sure why my mind felt so clear. I had gone into the temazcal expecting a simple detox, but I left with a reset mind and spirit.

Would I do it again? Yes. But it’s tough. It demands surrender.

If you're hesitant about trying temazcal, don’t be. There are no substances, no tricks; just you, the heat, and your willpower.

And that’s enough to change you.
