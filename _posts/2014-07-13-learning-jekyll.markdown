I had some time to rest up and take a break from coding this weekend. I think of it as a celebratory break from 'graduating' phase_1. One thing that I've been trying to learn is Jekyll.

I want to organize what I need to do for my personal website:

  * Work on navigation bar.
  * Categories section needs to be updated.
  * About section needs to be written / updated.
  * Pagnate_path needs to be updated.
  * Technical posts need to be written / updated.

I will definitely try my best to update my website with the points above, and try to write posts on my learning.
