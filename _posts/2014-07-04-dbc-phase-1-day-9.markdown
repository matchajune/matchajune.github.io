Already two weeks have passed since phase_1 started. My superego was going absolutely crazy today. A part of it had to do with how overwhelmed I started to feel about the curriculum. I haven't completed any of the challenges on Wednesday, and today was the first time I felt like I couldn't understand the material as fast as I normally would. 

My partner did a good job keeping me grounded today. He reminded me of the Emotional Engineering class our cohort took yesterday, and to keep working hard on the SQL challenges. Although I felt completely lost, by the end of the day, I actually felt okay with the challenges presented.

I am starting to realize how expensive it is to eat out everyday for lunch. I should really limit the amount of times I eat out per week. In addition, I'm starting to feel fat because of all the food I'm constantly eating.

I am almost done with phase_1 and I'm worried that I will not be ready for phase_2. In addition, I should really spend some time to start organizing my website and start really deploying quality posts. I am currently just saving all the .markdown files.
